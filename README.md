# Description

The workshop is geared towards linguists interested in analyzing data from various types of experiments (truth-value judgments, Likert scale judgments, response times, reading times, etc). We'll be focusing on regression methods, in particular mixed effects models, which have proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing linguistic data (see also Harald Baayen's book "Analyzing Linguistic Data", linked below). To get the most out of it in the short amount of time, the workshop contains a large hands-on component in which participants will have the opportunity to analyze existing datasets and bring their own.

# Preparation

We will be using R in this course. To get the most out of it, please bring your laptop and come with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed.

If you have never used R before, I recommend working through chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the Introduction to R on https://www.datacamp.com/home -- it sounds like a lot, but each "chapter" is actually just a few short exercises, and it'll get you used to writing basic R code. 

# Schedule 

Apart from the very first session (and food sessions...) the workshop will consist of a mix of lectures on my part interwoven with practical exercises so everyone can get their hands dirty with data after the introduction of any new concept. On the first day we'll be focusing on the general concept of regression and its simplest instantiation, (mixed effects) linear regression for continuous data (e.g., response times, reading times, slider ratings). On the second day we'll turn to logistic regression for binary data (e.g., truth-value judgment data or any other binary choice) and ordinal regression ...for ordinal data (e.g., Likert scale ratings). I also want to spend a significant amount of time on data visualization with ggplot.

I'll be adding code sheets here for participants to follow along with as I finalize them.
