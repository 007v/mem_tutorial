# Description

 for becoming familiar with mixed effects regression models in R. We'll be analyzing various 

# Preparation

Please come with R and RStudio installed.

If you have never used R before, I recommend working through chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the Introduction to R on https://www.datacamp.com/home -- it sounds like a lot, but each "chapter" is actually just a few short exercises, and it'll get you used to writing basic R code. 

# Schedule

Apart from the very first session (and food sessions...) the workshop will consist of a mix of lectures on my part interwoven with practical exercises.
