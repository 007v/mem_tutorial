# What's the distribution of correct/incorrect responses?
table(lexdec$Correct)
prop.table(table(lexdec$Correct))

# Recall that R by default interprets factor levels in alphanumeric order:
contrasts(lexdec$Correct)

# Let's re-order levels to be predicting the log odds of a correct over an incorrect response
lexdec$Correct = factor(lexdec$Correct, levels=c("incorrect", "correct"))

# We start with a simple model. The syntax is the same as in the linear model, but we use the function glmer(). The only difference is the outcome variable and the family (assumed noise distribution) now is binomial.
m = glmer(Correct ~ (1|Subject) + (1|Word), family="binomial", data=lexdec)

m = glmer(Correct ~ Frequency + (1|Subject) + (1|Word), family="binomial", data=lexdec)
summary(m)

# 1. What is the interpretation of the coefficients?

# If we want to instead get the intercept for the grand mean, we need to center frequency first:
source("code_sheets/helpers.R")
centered = cbind(lexdec,myCenter(lexdec[,c("Frequency","NativeLanguage","FamilySize")]))
head(centered)
summary(centered)

m = glmer(Correct ~ cFrequency + (1|Subject) + (1|Word), family="binomial", data=centered)
summary(m)

# We can add additional predictors just as in the linear model
m = glmer(Correct ~ Frequency * NativeLanguage + FamilySize + (1|Subject) + (1|Word), family="binomial", data=lexdec)
summary(m)

m = glmer(Correct ~ cFrequency * cNativeLanguage + cFamilySize + (1|Subject) + (1|Word), family="binomial", data=centered)
